In previous versions, Material-UI has used LESS, then a custom inline-style solution to write the component styles, but these approaches have proven to be limited. A CSS-in-JS solution overcomes many of those limitations, and unlocks many great features (theme nesting, dynamic styles, self-support, etc.).

Material-UI's styling solution is inspired by many other styling libraries such as styled-components and emotion.

💅 You can expect the same advantages as styled-components.
🚀 It's blazing fast.
🧩 It's extensible via a plugin API.
⚡️ It uses JSS at its core – a high performance JavaScript to CSS compiler which works at runtime and server-side.
