After his team mate Carlos Sainz failed even to take the race start
Lando Norris wound up saving face for McLaren at the Belgian Grand Prix by claiming P7
But having started in P10, Norris felt that, had the race been just one lap longer
he could have finished even higher up than that

Norris’ strong pace in the latter stages of the race allowed him to breeze up to the back of a fight between Red Bull’s Alex Albon and Renault’s Esteban Ocon
who were squabbling over fifth place
And although Ocon was able to sail past the Red Bull on the final lap to claim P5
Norris ran out of laps to copy the move on his close friend Albon.
